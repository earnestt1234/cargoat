    "This post contains some vignettes demonstrating how [cargoat](https://github.com/earnestt1234/cargoat) can be used to simulate the [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples used below are taken from an [Untrammeled Mind post](https://www.untrammeledmind.com/2018/11/monty-hall-problem-and-variations-intuitive-solutions/) which provides descriptions and mathematical formulations of several Monty Hall problem variations.  Because of the fantastic explanations in that existing post, these vignettes will not focus on re-deriving the same theoretical answers for these problems.  Rather, it will show that the same answers are supported empirically (while simultaneously showing how cargoat is used).  **Please read the Untrammeled Mind post for more thorough explanation and intuition.**\n",

    "## 1. Classic Monty Hall (three doors)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a restatement of the classic Monty Hall problem (directly quoted from Untrammeled Mind):\n",
    "\n",
    "> You stand before three closed doors. The doors are evenly spaced and appear identical, aside from being numbered from 1 to 3. One of the doors conceals a car, while each of the other two doors conceals a goat. The host of this game, Monty Hall, asks you to select a door. If you select the car door, you get to keep the car. You select Door 1, hoping to win the car. But wait. Hall opens Door 2 to reveal a goat. Hall, who knows where the car is, always reveals a goat. (Also assume that, when a contestant chooses the car door, Hall chooses which of the two goat doors to open with equal probability.) You chose Door 1, but are now given the option to switch your guess to Door 3. What’s the probability of winning if you switch?\n",
    "\n",
    "After Monty reveals a goat-containing door, is it better to switch to the remaining door or keep your original one?  This is the key question.  Again, here we will not work up an intuition for the answer to this question - rather, we are going to simulate the above scenario many times and see which behavior (switching doors or not) results in more wins (selecting the door with the car in it).\n",

    "Let's start by importing cargoat."

    "## 3. Forgetful Monty Hall (three doors)\n",
    "\n",
    "AKA, \"Monty Fall\". Here, Monty *doesn't know* which doors have cars or goats.  After the player picks, Monty still reveals a door, picking from the remaining ones *at random*.  He only sees two doors to pick (the currently picked door is omitted), and basically flips a coin to choose between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we simulate this with cargoat?  We must revisit the `Reveal()` action.  If we look at [its documentation](https://earnestt1234.github.io/cargoat/cargoat/#cargoat.Reveal), there are three `exclude_...` arguments which mark some doors as being off limits for being revealed.  By editing these options, we can simulate what information Monty Hall has, and which doors he randomly picks from.  `exclude_current` prevents any currently revealed doors from being selected again; since Monty only reveals doors once in this game variant, this action is not relevant.  `exclude_picked` prevents doors the player has selected from being revealed, and we still want this to be the case.  But `exclude_cars` needs to change; Monty doesn't know where the cars are, so he should not use that information for deciding which doors to reveal.\n",
